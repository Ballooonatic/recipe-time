# Recipe API

For this javascript project we've provided an API with two endpoints. With this API, you'll need to create a tool with at least two views â€“ list and detail. You'll also need to handle relations between the two endpoints, creating interface adjustments and actions which relate the data.

#### Endpoints
- /recipes-with-ingredients
- /specials-on-ingredients

#### API Schema
